I don't talk with the likes of YOU, not-oracle.
It's YOUR kind that brings us all down, not-oracle.
not-oracle!
Oh, one of YOU.
Oh look, a not-oracle!
oracles are better than your kind, not-oracle.
You're the ugliest not-oracle I've ever seen!
I'm an oracle and you're not!
not-oracle! not-oracle! not-oracle!
not-oracle! Ew! Go away!
Go away not-oracle!
You're a dirty not-oracle.
Filthy not-oracle.
Know your place, not-oracle.
Let's set things straight. I'm an oracle. And you're a not-oracle.
