	//BASE. is a special top level package, it finds the last implemented method (there can be override priority) with that subpath in any package
	//game. is the actual package most base game things will use- you can override it but in most cases it should be better to just
	//use your own and assume that anything that wants that subpath will call on BASE, even from within that package
	//content are actual structs only, a subpackage would use the above format to nest itself
	contents: [
	//note that this is dynamically typed, with the types being:
	//number: ints, doubles, and both used as booleans. first, check if there's a decimal. if so, double. otherwise, int. If used as a boolean, >0 is true, otherwise false.
	//string: either a 'ref' to a struct in a package somewhere, actionable data, or a normal string. all are stored the same
	//array/object: more json-like, these are structures rather than a base type. arrays are lists, objects are maps.
	//however, there are special commands to inherit and override
	//using @paste inside a struct will take a struct from somewhere else and put it's contents also here
	//& will add to a struct we already have in the current scope (usually after pasting)- otherwise it overwrites when you do that
	//collisions WITHIN that will still overwrite, but any old keys will be used base
	//+ is that, except any keys will be added if the computer can figure out how (which is only possible if there is an instruction
	//within that struct on how to do so, for example, formula = weight adds numbers, formula = mult adds numbers)
	//likewise, * is + but with multiplication instead, and there is also - and /, and ^ which removes keys if the thing assigned to them resolves to true
