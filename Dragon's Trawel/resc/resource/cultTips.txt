Blood for the blood queen!
Praise flagjaij!
For the blood!
Praise! Praise!
Flagjaij be with you.
Renounce your false gods, Flagjaij is the one true god.
Hail, brother. Bit of snow too.
Glory to- uh, what was our god's name again?
This blood kinda tastes like grape juice.
Do you have a minute to talk about Flagjaij?
I know I was supposed to sacrifice the virgin to Flagjaij today but she's, uh, not eligible anymore.
My eyes are opened unto the truth.
