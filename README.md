# Trawel-Text
A open world text adventure rpg.

Currently undergoing a massive rewrite in July 2023.

If you are vision impaired and using a screenreader for this text, the following portions have inline links. You can find a compiled version at "real.itch.io/trawel", but that might be out of date.      <br>  <br>

  
Trawel can be found on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/992240/Trawel/) for ~$5 USD, which also includes a graphical, and for free ($0) on [Itch.io](https://real.itch.io/trawel).

If you wish to try the game out and don't mind the [cli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface), Itch or the Steam Demo are probably your best bet, since they will have compiled jars. (The demo is also free, and comes with both a jre and .bath/.sh files to start the program easier.) The source code here is frequently in states of disrepair.

Occasionally the Itch/Demo version will lag behind the Steam release, and you might be able to compile a more up-to-date version; this will probably be the last release in GitHub's sidebar, but that might also be out of date.

The code here will always be at or ahead of Steam's (even when there is a beta available), because the Steam version merely takes the compiled jars resulting from the code here.        <br><br>

Trawel text is [Source-available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software),  but not [Libre](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Libre_software).

You may not redistribute Trawel Text or it's source code, (exempting parts not unique to Trawel Text) but may redistribute modifications to it, as long as they do not contain the source code.

The exception to this (right now) is forks on GitHub proper- since they include a direct link back to this repo, and GitHub is authorized to redistribute this code.

You may modify Trawel Text's source code, as long as you do not redistribute it.

  <br>
However, if you wish to use parts of Trawel in your own software (even commercial), just ask [@realDragon11](https://github.com/realDragon11). The intention is to prevent asset flipping and whole resale of Trawel Text, not to disallow copying entirely. If Trawel Text has become abandonware (>10 years of no updates without v1.0), it is also likely fine.
